# Hi, I'm Chris Radford

Alum of four startups and MBA graduate—I currently work for Simply Business, an online insurance broker, managing two software engineering teams—I've spent the last decade bouncing around various startups and tech companies.

In recent years I've been focused on managing the humans behind the software, leading and managing multiple teams each with their own managers, totaling around twenty engineers across different geographies and timezones.

Prior to engineering management my focus was on payment systems, developing integrations on every continent except Antarctica, and across mobile, app, and web platforms.

In my free time I compete in obstacle course races, run with a local running club, and practice yoga.
